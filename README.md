# Projects

## [Infinite scroll 25](./25.%Infinite%20scroll)

#### :tada: Project overview:

Infinite scrolling which is a way to paginate. App fetch ten posts initially and as scroll you can see css loader and application is going to grab five more posts and so on. Posts are fetching from an API [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).  
I also implement search filter, we can type in a word and filter the posts we already have on page.

#### :rocket: Motivation:

Sometimes on websites we can see pagination numbers at the bottom with arrows so we can click to go to next page of content. In this case I decided to deal with blog posts or application like Twitter where we keep scrolling and it is basically infinite scroll.
